Pruned Labeling for Reachability Queries
--------------

### What is this?
This is an implementation of Pruned Labeling methods for reachability queries on digraphs.
A reachability query (s, t) asks if there is a path between two nodes s and t.
Our program quickly answers reachability queries on a given graph by precomputing an index.

### About Pruned Labeling
Pruned Landmark Labeling (PLL) and Pruned Path Labeling (PPL) are fast and scalable methods for reachability queries.
